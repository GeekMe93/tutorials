## Why I created this websites?

Technical writing is a big part of my life. I have tried many typesetting tools to make documentation like Markdown, HTML, LaTeX. Each has it own uniqueness. Markdown is simply and readable even for a very long essay. The drawback of Markdown is that it is flexible for customization. LaTeX is perfect for academic writing. Writing with good typography is as easy as Markdown when a perfect template is specified. I have been using LaTeX for many documentations. However, when your document is getting longer and longer, the readability of you LaTeX code will be harmed. Then I begin to think about HTML which has very diverse functionality with good CSS and Javascript. Most important feature I think is you can access all files with just a click as all the files could be linked together. All you need is a web browser. However, writing HTML tags in your text editor could be a huge pain. The question now raises: 

{% include callout.html content="Can we combine the simplicity of Markdown and the functionality of HTML?" type="primary" %} 

The answer is ***YES***! The solution lies in <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.jekyll_platform}}">Jekyll</a> and <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.github}}">GitHub</a>.

        <h4>Sharing</h4>
        <p>Sharing ideas the always the best experience for me. Nowadays, there are a variety of ways to share. I use this site and my blog as sharing points, hoping to make friends and learn from from them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-two">
        <h4>Learning</h4>
        <p>Learn to learn. The best way to learn is to present yourself to the public, and get ideas from salient people. Every person should master at least one programming language to facilitate your workflow. Also this is a good way to carry out interdisciplinary work.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-three">
        <h4>Summarizing</h4>
        <p>Don't trust your memory. It's always better to your ideas and thoughts down in a systematic way. During this process you will gain a deeper insight into the topic. Moreover, well-organized summary materials are good reference in your projects.</p>
